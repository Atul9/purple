This is a full rust implementation of the Purple Protocol.

Purple is a decentralized, programmable, multi-asset blockchain protocol that is capable of processing an immense volume of transactions with ease. It has been built from the ground up and is using a completely new consensus algorithm.

The main features of the protocol are its open and decentralized nature, it's capability of processing a large amount of transactions, its multi-asset capabilities and the ability to run decentralized applications and smart contracts.  

## Building
Building the project requires the latest rust nightly toolchain, llvm and libsodium. After all these are installed, run `cargo build`.
